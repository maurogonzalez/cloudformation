# Ansible + AWSCloudformation Examples

This project tries to cover some AWS management through
[AWSCloudformation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html) using [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html) as automation tool.

## Requirements <a name="requirements" />

- [ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

- [boto3](https://pypi.org/project/boto3/):

## Getting ready <a name="getting-ready" />

Clone this repo:
```
# Move to your working path
$ git clone https://github.com/maurogonzalez/cloudformation.git
$ cd cloudformation
```

## Roles <a name="roles" />

The general `playbook` is `playbook.yml`. It receives the role variable
to set which role is going to be played. Each role needs an `environment`
variable which is already set in `inventory/dev.yml` but it can be 
overridden in the command (I suggest to use inventory as it is easier to
set variables/values corresponding to a given scope).

The command to run each implemented role is as follows:
```
$  ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory/dev.yml -e "role=$ROLE profile=default" playbook.yml
```
